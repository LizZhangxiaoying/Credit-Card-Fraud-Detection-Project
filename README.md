Credit Card Fraud Detection

The goal of this project is to analyze transaction patterns and build a machine learning model capable of reliably distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. This project aims to enhance fraud detection systems, which are critical for financial institutions to prevent unauthorized transactions and minimize financial losses.

Approach

Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive dataset of real-world credit card transactions. The dataset includes features such as:

Transaction amount
Location
Timestamp
User behavior patterns
Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and normalizing the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Feature Engineering
Selecting and transforming features most indicative of fraudulent behavior.
Modeling
Applying machine learning algorithms to train a classification model that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent.
Evaluation
Testing the modelâ€™s performance using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Impact

This system addresses a critical concern in the digital payment ecosystem by enhancing the security of financial transactions. It achieves this by reliably identifying fraudulent activities with high accuracy, helping financial institutions reduce unauthorized transactions and minimize financial losses.

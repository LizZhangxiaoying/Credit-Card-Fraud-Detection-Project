# Credit Card Fraud Detection


The goal of this project is to analyze transaction patterns and build a machine learning model capable of reliably distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. This project aims to enhance fraud detection systems, which are critical for financial institutions to prevent unauthorized transactions and minimize financial losses.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing** : Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features most indicative of fraudulent behavior.
- **Fraud Detection Modeling**: Easily manage your tasks by setting priorities.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Set up recurring tasks and reminders to stay on track.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive and intuitive UI built with React.js.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Optimized for performance across cloud infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
**Programming Language**:
 - Python

**Machine Learning Libraries**:
- Scikit-Learn

**Data Visualization Tools**:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of real-world credit card transactions, including features such as:
- Transaction Amount
- Location
- Timestamp
- User Behavior Patterns
